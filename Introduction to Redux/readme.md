# Redux

Redux is a `predictable` `state container` for `Javascript Applications`.

1.  Javascript Applications
    -   Not tied to just React only.
    -   Can be used with other Framework (Angular or Vue) or even with Vanilla Js.
    -   Redux is a library for Javascript Applications.

2.  It's a State container
    -   It Stores State of container.
    -   `State of an App` is the state represented by all individual component of an App.

3.  Redux is predictable
    -   All State transactions are explicit & it is possible to keep track of them.The change to your Application state becomes predictable.
    -   e.g. Todo List app: Item(pending) -> Item (completed).
