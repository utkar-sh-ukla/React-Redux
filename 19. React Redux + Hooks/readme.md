# React-Redux + Hooks

- React's new "hooks" APIs give function components the ability to use local component state, execute side effects, and more.
- React also lets us write custom hooks, which let us extract reusable hooks to add our own behavior on top of React's built-in hooks.
- React Redux includes its own custom hook APIs, which allow your React components to subscribe to the Redux store and dispatch actions.
- Hooks were first added in v7.1.0.
