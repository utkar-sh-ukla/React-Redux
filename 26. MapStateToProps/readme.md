# mapStateToProps

- It should take a first argument called state, optionally a second argument called ownProps, and return a plain object containing the data that the connected component needs.

```js
function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps?)
```

### Arguments 

- state
  - The first argument to a mapStateToProps function is the entire Redux store state (the same value returned by a call to store.getState()). Because of this, the first argument is traditionally just called state.

- ownProps
  - If your component needs the data from its own props to retrieve data from the store. This argument will contain all of the props given to the wrapper component that was generated by connect.

### Folder Structure

```

|__components
  +|__ItemContainer.js

```

### ItemContainer

```js

import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

function ItemContainer (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Item - {props.item} </h2>
    </div>
  )
}

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  const itemState = ownProps.cake ? state.cake.numOfCakes : state.iceCream.numOfIceCream
  return {
    item: itemState
  }
}



export default connect(mapStateToProps)(ItemContainer)
```
