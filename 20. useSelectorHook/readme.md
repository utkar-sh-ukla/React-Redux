#  useSelector()

- Allows you to extract data from the Redux store state, using a selector function.

```
const result: any = useSelector(selector: Function, equalityFn?: Function)
```

- The selector is approximately equivalent to the `mapStateToProps` argument to `connect` conceptually.
- The selector will be called with the entire Redux store state as its only argument.
- The selector will be run whenever the function component renders (unless its reference hasn't changed since a previous render of the component so that a cached result can be returned by the hook without re-running the selector).
-  `useSelector()` will also subscribe to the Redux store, and run your selector whenever an action is dispatched.
